                        <p>Before deciding to participate in the Cryptocurrency market, you should carefully consider
                            your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not
                            invest money; you cannot afford to lose.

                            initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position.
                            If you fail to meet any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated, and you will be
                            responsible for any resulting losses. A cryptocurrency (foreign exchange) carries a
                            high-risk level and may not be suitable for all investors. There is a possibility that you
                            may sustain a loss equal to or greater than your entire investment. Therefore, you should
                            not invest or risk money that you cannot afford to lose.
