                        <p class="pt-2">Digital currencies are currencies (or money systems) that are only available electronically
                            or digitally. They can therefore only be accessed via computers, including smartphones, and
                            have no physical existence. Perhaps the best-known digital currency is Bitcoin, but there
                            are many more.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">Digital currencies have many advantages, but also some disadvantages. However, they are now
                            becoming much more mainstream. For example, the Bank of England has announced that it is
                            considering establishing a digital currency. It is therefore worth understanding a bit more
                            about how digital currencies work, and especially where things might go wrong.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">Types of Digital Currency</p>
                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>There are three main types of digital currency.</strong></p>
                        <h3 class="pt-3">1- Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>Cryptocurrencies use&nbsp;<em>cryptography</em>&nbsp;or coding to secure and verify
                                transactions</strong></p>
                        <p class="pt-2">This means that they are created using complex bits of computer code. More complex code is
                            also used to record and verify transactions. For example, Bitcoin is the best known
                            cryptocurrency. It is ‘mined’ by individuals or organizations solving complex computer
                            puzzles, which get harder as more Bitcoin are mined. Each transaction is recorded through a
                            system called blockchain. This records all transactions and holds those records across a
                            network of computers owned and managed by individuals, rather than a central system. Each
                            user therefore contributes to the blockchain, meaning that records cannot be falsified.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are therefore described
                                as&nbsp;<em>decentralized</em>, because they are not controlled by central banks or
                                governments.</strong>&nbsp;Indeed, many cryptocurrencies were created precisely to avoid
                            this kind of control.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3 class="pt-3">2- Virtual currencies</h3>
                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>Virtual currencies are unregulated digital currencies that are created and controlled
                                by developers or algorithms following a clear set of rules.</strong></p>
                        <p class="pt-2">These types of currencies are interesting because they extend the concept of currency beyond
                            the simple ‘buy and sell’. Instead, they transfer&nbsp;<em>value</em>. For example, a video
                            game token may give you an extra life, or more power, but does not have a direct cash value.
                            You could also argue that systems like Hong Kong’s Octopus card, and Transport for London’s
                            Oyster card are virtual currencies, because they allow users to hold value on a piece of
                            plastic, including both travelcards and a cash equivalent that can be used to pay for
                            journeys.</p>
                        <h3 class="pt-3">3- Central bank digital currencies</h3>
                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>Central bank digital currencies are regulated and issued by the central banks of
                                particular countries.</strong></p>
                        <p class="pt-2">They can replace or supplement standard currency. The central banks of several countries have
                            announced that they are considering issuing a digital currency. These digital currencies are
                            therefore completely centralized: the total opposite of most cryptocurrencies.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">These digital currencies are therefore likely to be much less volatile than many other
                            digital currencies, because they are backed by a central bank. Investors are likely to have
                            the same faith in them as in the physical currency—which of course may be affected by
                            government actions.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">&nbsp;</p>
                        <h2>Advantages of Digital Currencies</h2>
                        <p class="pt-2">Digital currencies have a number of advantages. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Fast transfer and transaction times</strong>. Transactions do not need an
                                intermediary, so can be much faster than transfers of physical money provided that users
                                are in the same network.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transparency of process</strong>. As well as being fast, the electronic transfer
                                also provides a clear record of every transaction. Whether that is via a bank’s systems,
                                or using blockchain, the transactions are visible.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reduced costs of transfer</strong>. By making transactions and transfers more
                                direct and faster, digital currencies can reduce the number of intermediaries, and
                                therefore make transactions cheaper.</li>
                            <li><strong>There are no physical manufacturing requirements</strong>. Unlike physical
                                money, you do not need to manufacture coins or notes, or worry about them being damaged
                                in circulation. However, there is still a cost associated with mining cryptocurrencies,
                                which is often overlooked (see box below).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="pt-3">Disadvantages of Digital Currencies</h3>
                        <p class="pt-2">Speed of transactions is an obvious advantage, but digital currencies also have a number of
                            important drawbacks, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>They still need storing and processing capacity</strong>. You may not need bank
                                vaults to hold digital currencies, but they still need storage—and that means computer
                                space. This is not without cost, including in energy terms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital currencies are not always secure.&nbsp;</strong>Just as physical
                                currencies are vulnerable to forgers, digital currencies are vulnerable to hackers.
                                Hackers may steal currency from digital wallets, or go direct to source, changing the
                                protocol or algorithm, and affecting the value. Nobody has really managed to completely
                                solve this problem yet—but then, preventing forgery of physical currencies is also still
                                an ongoing process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Digital currencies can be very volatile</strong>. All currency trading depends
                                on investor confidence. However, it is much harder to have confidence in a digital
                                currency, especially if you do not know its provenance. The history of digital
                                currencies has shown some big swings in value in very short periods of time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pt-2">&nbsp;</p>
                        <h3 class="pt-3">A final thought</h3>
                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>Not all digital currencies are equal.</strong></p>
                        <p class="pt-2">Different forms of digital currency have different characteristics. For example,
                            cryptocurrencies are decentralized, and central bank digital currencies are centralized.
                            There is also considerable variation even within categories. For example, different
                            cryptocurrencies may have very different characteristics.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">This means that they may also have different disadvantages and advantages. Some types may
                            overcome the disadvantages of other types, but will have other advantages of their own. For
                            example, few other forms of cryptocurrency have achieved the level of security of
                            Bitcoin—but the high level of computing power required for Bitcoin is a serious
                            disadvantage.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2">The development of digital currencies is therefore very much an ongoing process. It is worth
                            staying up to speed on it.</p>
