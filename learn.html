                            conventional money,
                            or trade them for profits. However, unlike conventional money which is issued and controlled
                            by governments, digital currencies are decentralized and there is no single entity that
                            controls their issue.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2">The first cryptocurrency to be created was bitcoin in 2008 by a mysterious
                            person or group
                            going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin’s introduction was only the beginning of an
                            influx of a myriad of cryptocurrencies, all launched with the aim of replacing bitcoin. All
                            those other currencies that came after bitcoin are today known as altcoins - alternatives to
                            bitcoin.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2">Today there are over 5,000 cryptocurrencies circulating in the market, and more
                            will come up.
                            After bitcoin, the second largest and popular cryptocurrency in the world today is Ethereum.
                            Ethereum is especially popular because of its products such as decentralized finance (DeFi)
                            and non-fungible
                            tokens (NFTs).</p>

                                    However, the expected outcome times are quite different: in investing, the outcome

                        <p class="pt-2">There are about 7,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation in the current market.
                            Pick a crypto
                            currency based on the criteria of performance and its longevity in the market. You want to
                            trade
                            a currency that will offer you reasonable returns in the long run. As a beginner, avoid
                            trading
                            initial coin offerings (ICOs) because you do not know their success rate or how legitimate

                            are.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2">As the saying goes, "do not put all your eggs in one basket" and this rule
                            applies in digital
                            assets as well as stocks. Investing in digital assets can be lucrative but, likewise, the
                            possibility of total loss come in equal measure. Diversifying across several altcoins helps
                            you
                            to cut your losses in case one cryptocurrency drops in price.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2">Like any other financial asset, cryptocurrencies can either be profitable or you
                            can lose money.
                            The crypto market is risky and, as an investor, it would be wise to only invest sums of
                            money
                            you can afford to lose. The current market crash was not predictable, yet it happened. There
                            have been other crashes before, and likely more will occur in the future. There is never a

                        <p class="pt-2">Trading cryptocurrency has become a global phenomenon in recent times. Almost
                            everyone is
                            trading, and there is a human tendency to do what everyone else is doing. There is a version
                            of
                            trading in crypto known as day trading which is more like the stock market in traditional
                            finance. If you decide to participate in day trading, watch out for fear of missing out,
                            also
                            known as FOMO, as it is the fastest way to lose money. You should also avoid trading when
                            you
                            feel pressured.</p>

                        <h3 class="pt-3">Keep yourself up to date with cryptocurrencies</h3>

                        <p class="pt-2">The cryptocurrency market is evolving daily, and with it comes new aspects of
                            the trade. To do
                            well in investments, you should stay up to date on what is going on. Social media platforms
                            such
                            as Twitter, Facebook and Telegram, as well as cable news, are excellent channels to get
                            reliable
                            news. As the market changes, adjust your investments accordingly to ensure profits.</p>

                        <h3 class="pt-3">Keep up with the latest trends</h3>

                        <p class="pt-2">With the world of cryptocurrency business evolving so rapidly, it is critical to
                            keep up to date
                            with recent developments and notable trends. It may be beneficial to have a platform where
                            you
                            can collect information to make an accurate judgment regarding trends and user opinions. For
                            instance, it is possible to create a trading-related platform using crypto
                            web templates. Here, people will be ready to post comments and ideas that may be
                            valuable to you and all your other viewers.</p>

                        <h3 class="pt-3">Learn trading methods and staking</h3>

                        <p class="pt-2">There are two trading analysis methods used in the crypto market. They include
                            fundamental
                            analysis and technical analysis. Technical analysis shows the entire price history of a
                            security, for example bitcoin, while fundamental analysis revolves around the current
                            affairs
                            that affect the price of a security such as news events. A combination of both methods works
                            best to maximize profits. You can always start staking your crypto
                            and
                            earn passive income. This is one of the easiest methods to gain from crypto in the long
                            term.</p>


                        <h3 class="pt-3">Mistakes do happen</h3>

                        <p class="pt-2"><strong>Cryptocurrency trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme</strong>. It takes
                            discipline,
                            practice and skills to succeed in trading. However, even professional traders at times do
                            make
                            mistakes while trading and realize losses. Cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky and
                            trading
                            might result in the loss of capital. As such, learning skills such as risk
                            management and trading discipline. And don’t lose hope when you, when
                            mistakes happen. Learn from the mistakes.</p>
